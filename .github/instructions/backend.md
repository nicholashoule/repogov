# Backend Instructions

## API Design

- Follow RESTful conventions: use nouns for resources, HTTP verbs for actions
- Version APIs from the start (e.g., `/api/v1/`)
- Return consistent JSON response shapes: `{ data, error, meta }`
- Use standard HTTP status codes accurately (200, 201, 400, 401, 403, 404, 500)
- Document all endpoints in an OpenAPI/Swagger spec or equivalent

## Error Handling

- Never expose internal stack traces or system paths in API responses
- Return structured error objects with a code, message, and optional detail field
- Log errors server-side with context (request ID, user ID where applicable)
- Distinguish between client errors (4xx) and server errors (5xx)

## Authentication and Authorization

- Validate and sanitize all input at the API boundary
- Use bearer tokens or session cookies consistently -- do not mix approaches
- Check authorization before loading data, not after
- Document required permissions for each endpoint

## Data and Storage

- Use parameterized queries or ORM methods -- never string-interpolate SQL
- Keep business logic out of SQL; prefer service-layer transforms
- Handle connection errors gracefully with appropriate retries or fallback
- Document schema migrations and keep them reversible

## Testing

- Write unit tests for service and business logic in isolation
- Write integration tests for database-touching code against a test database
- Test error paths and boundary conditions, not just happy paths
- Use table-driven or data-driven tests for multiple input/output combinations

## Documentation

- Document request and response shapes with examples
- Note rate limits, authentication requirements, and pagination behavior
- Keep API docs co-located with implementation or in `docs/api/`
- Update docs in the same PR that changes the API
