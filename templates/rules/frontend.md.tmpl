# Frontend Instructions

## Component Structure

- Keep components focused on a single responsibility
- Separate presentational components from data-fetching logic
- Co-locate styles, tests, and stories with the component file
- Use consistent file naming for the framework (e.g., `ComponentName.tsx`, `ComponentName.test.tsx`)

## State Management

- Prefer local state over global state where possible
- Document the shape of shared state with types or interfaces
- Avoid prop-drilling beyond two levels -- use context or a state store
- Keep side effects isolated and clearly labeled

## API Integration

- Centralize API calls in a dedicated service or hook layer
- Handle loading, error, and empty states explicitly in UI components
- Do not hard-code base URLs -- use environment variables
- Type API responses at the boundary to catch shape mismatches early

## Accessibility

- All interactive elements must be keyboard-navigable
- Use semantic HTML elements before reaching for ARIA attributes
- Provide alt text for all images and icons
- Test with a screen reader before shipping new interactive components

## Testing

- Write unit tests for utility functions and hooks
- Write component tests for rendering and interaction logic
- Prefer testing user-visible behavior over implementation details
- Use end-to-end tests sparingly for critical user journeys

## Documentation

- Document component props with types and descriptions
- Note any setup requirements (environment variables, feature flags)
- Keep a Storybook or equivalent for shared UI components
- Link to design specs or Figma files for visual reference
